Subscriptions allow you to charge users on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly or yearly) for access to services or communities. Powered by the **Patronize** contract.

## Creating a Plan

A Plan defines the terms of the subscription: price and duration.

```typescript
import { createSubscriptionPlan } from '@twinkle/sdk';
import { parseEther } from 'viem';

const { planId } = await createSubscriptionPlan(walletClient, publicClient, {
  price: parseEther("100"), // 100 MNEE
  interval: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 30 Days (in seconds)
});
```

## Subscribing

Users subscribe to a plan ID.

```typescript
import { subscribeToPlan } from '@twinkle/sdk';

await subscribeToPlan(walletClient, publicClient, planId);
```

## Checking Status

You can check if a subscription is currently active. The contract calculates the expiration date based on the last payment time + interval.

```typescript
import { isSubscribedToPlan } from '@twinkle/sdk';

const isActive = await isSubscribedToPlan(
  publicClient,
  planId,
  userAddress
);
```
