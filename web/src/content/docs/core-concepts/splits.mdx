Revenue Splits (powered by **SoundSplit**) solve the problem of collaboration. Instead of one person receiving funds and manually sending them to others, a Split contract automatically routes incoming tokens to pre-defined recipients based on percentages.

## Creating a Split

You define a list of recipients and their shares. The total shares typically add up to 100, but the contract logic is based on `shares / totalShares`.

```typescript
import { createSplit } from '@twinkle/sdk';

const { splitId } = await createSplit(walletClient, publicClient, {
  recipients: ["0xAlice...", "0xBob..."],
  shares: [50n, 50n] // Equal split
});
```

## Receiving Funds

The `splitId` maps to a smart contract address. Any MNEE sent to this address is effectively "in the split".

Smart contract wallets cannot typically "push" payments automatically to EOA wallets without gas. Therefore, Twinkle Splits use a **Pull** mechanism (or a "Distribute" trigger).

## Distributing Funds

Anyone can trigger the distribution. This function calculates the pending balance for each recipient and sends it to them.

```typescript
import { distributeSplit } from '@twinkle/sdk';

// Distributes all pending MNEE in the split to its members
await distributeSplit(walletClient, publicClient, splitId);
```
