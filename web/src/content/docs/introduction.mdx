# Welcome to Twinkle

Twinkle Protocol is a suite of payment primitives designed for the decentralized web. We provide a simple, unified SDK to handle complex crypto-economic flows like **paywalls**, **recurring subscriptions**, **revenue splits**, and **escrow**.

Our goal is to make "getting paid on-chain" as easy as integrating Stripe, but with the power of smart contracts and autonomous agents.

## Why Twinkle?



*   **For Creators**: Monetize your content directly. Launch a paywall for your blog, a subscription for your newsletter, or split revenue with collaborators instantly.
*   **For Developers**: Stop writing boilerplate Solidity. Use our audited, secure contracts via a simple TypeScript SDK. Integrate in minutes, not weeks.
*   **For Agents**: Implementation of the **x402** standard allows AI agents to autonomously discover prices and pay for resources via HTTP headers.

## Features

- **Paywalls (`Unlock`)**: One-time payments to reveal content or data.
- **Subscriptions (`Patronize`)**: Recurring memberships with automatic expiry handling.
- **Revenue Splits (`SoundSplit`)**: Distribute incoming funds to multiple wallets automatically.
- **Escrow (`Milestone`)**: Job-based payments with milestone releases and dispute resolution.
- **Agent Payments (x402)**: Standardized headers for AI-to-AI commerce.
